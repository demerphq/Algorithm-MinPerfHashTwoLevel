Algorithm-MinPerfHashTwoLevel version 0.01
==========================================

This distribution contains two modules, Algorith::MinPerfHashTwoLevel
which can construct a "two level" minimal perfect hash in an abstract
form, and Tie::Hash::MinPerfHashTwoLevel::OnDisk which uses the
abstract representation to create an ondisk image of the hash which
can be efficiently mounted via mmap, allowing memory efficient access
to the hash by multiple processes at the same time.

Requires a 64 bit operating environment, and a little endian CPU.

INSTALLATION

To install these modules type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires a 64 bit build environment, a C compiler and a
little endian CPU.
