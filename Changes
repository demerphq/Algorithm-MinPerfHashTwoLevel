Revision history for Perl extension Algorithm::MinPerfHashTwoLevel.
0.15  Jun 06, 2019
    Use a better hash function, Siphash (1-3 variant), and take the opportunity
    to ditch the old variants. The latest and only supported variant is version 5.

    WARNING: This version is NOT capable of reading old files, use version 0.14
    to do that or regenerate from source using this version.

0.14  May 22, 2019
    Sigh. Yet another rerelease of the v0.11 changes, missed an upstream commit.
    There is no version 0.13, that is an unlucky number.

0.12  May 22, 2019
    Fixup MANIFEST. Otherwise identical to 0.11

0.11  May 21, 2019
    Switch to a deterministic seed construction, and avoid use of rand()
    when construction fails. Switch to a full file checksum, and from 16
    byte alignment to 8 byte alignment. Test improvements.

0.10  May 14, 2019
    Rework in XS for speed. Add a new variant 2, which has a more robust
    construction method which has a much higher chance of finding a solution
    for a given seed.

    Some performance optimisations.
    Fixups so we work correctly on Perl 5.8.9

0.08  Thurs Apr 25, 2019
    Better build refusal logic.

0.07  Weds Apr 24, 2019
    Refuse to build on Win32, and refuse to build without 64-bit integer
    support and little endian integers.

0.06  Weds Apr 24, 2019
    Fix building for FreeBSD. - Thanks to Slaven Slaven ReziÄ‡ for the

    Fix building under threaded perls.

0.04  Tue Apr 23 20:14:18 CEST 2019
    Fixup builds for 5.28.x where there is already a stadtx_hash.h
    included in the build process via perl headers.
    Fixup documentation of fetch algorithm.

0.03  Sat Mar 30 15:43:44 2019
    rename "version" to variant in all use cases
    add support for variant 1 as well as variant 0,
    variant 1 is faster to produce.
