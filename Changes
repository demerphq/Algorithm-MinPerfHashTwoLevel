Revision history for Perl extension Algorithm::MinPerfHashTwoLevel
and Tie::Hash::MinPerfHashTwoLevel::OnDisk.

0.16  Jun 17, 2019
    OnDisk: Close the file after creating the mmap(), the kernal will take a refcount
    on the file internally. This avoids running out of file descriptors when
    mapping many files. Thanks to Luciano Rocha for noticing this.
    Doc tweaks and cleanup changes given that 0.15 was a non backwards compatible
    release.

0.15  Jun 06, 2019
    Use a better hash function, Siphash (1-3 variant), and take the opportunity
    to ditch the old variants. The latest and only supported variant is version 5.

    WARNING: This version is NOT capable of reading old files, use version 0.14
    to do that or regenerate from source using this version.
